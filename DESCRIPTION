Description: The package predicts individual conditional cure rates and conditional 
    survival probabilities. The fitted joint model is our proposed joint cure model that simultaneously deals 
    with longitudinal data in a linear mixed-effects submodel 
    and flexible patterns of hazard ratios over time in a promotion time cure submodel.
    The model estimation for this proposed model can be found in the github cxie19/jmfhc.
