Description: The package predicts individual conditional cure rates and conditional 
    survival probabilities and also evaluates the fitted joint model's predictive performance 
    on conditional survival probabilities via the time-dependent area under 
    the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Brier score. 
    The fitted joint model is our proposed joint cure model that simultaneously deals 
    with longitudinal data in a linear mixed-effects submodel 
    and flexible patterns of hazard ratios over time in a promotion time cure submodel.
    The model estimation for this proposed model can be found in the github cxie19/jmfhc.
